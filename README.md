# Project Summary and Objectives
Project Name: Merchant Performance Analysis and Operations Improvement Using SQL
Project Description:
This project leverages SQL to analyze merchant performance, optimize operations, and identify growth opportunities within the dataset. It utilizes various SQL techniques, including Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, aggregations, and joins, to extract meaningful insights from sales, orders, and merchant data. The analysis is tailored for a B2B environment, aligning with the operational needs of companies like MaxAB.

# Objectives:
Analyze Revenue and Sales Trends:

Calculate total and cumulative sales for each merchant.
Identify top-performing merchants by monthly revenue.
Monitor Operational Performance:

Evaluate delivery performance by calculating average delivery times by region.
Identify geographic regions with low sales to prioritize improvements.
Identify Market Opportunities:

Highlight merchants with declining sales or inactivity.
Examine peak and low-demand times by analyzing daily and weekly trends.
Optimize Resource Allocation:

Rank merchants by their sales to focus on high-priority partners.
Assess operational efficiency through performance benchmarks like variance and standard deviation.
Enhance Payment Insights:

Calculate the percentage of orders made by different payment methods (e.g., cash vs. online).
# SQL Implementation Techniques:
Common Table Expressions (CTEs): 
Used for calculating total and cumulative sales and filtering recent orders.
Window Functions: Applied to rank merchants, calculate moving averages, and identify trends.
Aggregations and Grouping: Employed to compute total sales, average delivery times, and performance metrics.
Joins: Integrated to combine data from merchants, orders, and regions for comprehensive insights.
# Outcome Expectations:
A detailed understanding of merchant performance and operational gaps.
Actionable insights to improve logistics, prioritize merchants, and optimize sales strategies.
A robust SQL-based framework for regular performance monitoring and decision-making.
